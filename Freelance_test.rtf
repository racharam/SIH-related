Unmoderated tests are not monitored or guided by a moderator. The participant completes any tasks and answers questions at their own pace, on their own time at location of their choosing.\par
\par
Many UX teams rely on remote usability testing to efficiently get design feedback from users. There are two types of remote user testing:\par
\par
Moderated remote testing involves a researcher meeting with a participant via remote screen-sharing software, which allows the researcher to provide instructions, observe the user\rquote s interaction with the design in real time, and ask followup questions specific to that participant\rquote s session.\par
Unmoderated remote testing does not require a researcher to attend each test session; instead, a software application provides instructions to users, records their actions, and may ask them predetermined followup questions.\par
Unmoderated task: Unmoderated usability testing is defined as a way to conduct usability testing without a moderator being present. That means the participant will go through all of the tasks/instructions/questions solo.\par
Unmoderated usability sessions are completed alone by the participant. Although there is no real-time interaction with the participant, some tools for remote testing allow predefined follow-up questions to be built into the study, to be shown after each task or at the end of the session.\par
What is unmoderated content?\par
(of an online chatroom, newsgroup, etc) not monitored for inappropriate content, time wasting, or bad language.\par
What is moderated UserTesting?\par
During moderated testing, known as Live Conversations at UserTesting, an individual helps facilitate, or moderate, the study. The moderator works directly with test participants, guides them through the study, and answers questions in real-time if the participant encounters any challenges while completing their tasks.\par
What is a moderated user?\par
Moderated testing is a form of usability testing where a UX researcher, or moderator, helps facilitate the study alongside test participant(s).\par
Moderated usability tests need a facilitator to host, support, and collect responses whereas unmoderated tests see the participant complete tasks on their own. Both provide essential usability insights in product design and development.\par

Select a usability testing tool.\par
Set up the study.\par
Run a pilot test.\par
Recruit the participants.\par
Analyze the results.\par
\par
A pilot experiment, pilot study, pilot test or pilot project is a small-scale preliminary study\par
conducted to evaluate feasibility, duration, cost, adverse events, and improve upon the study design prior to performance of a full-scale research project.\par
A company has developed a new mobile app for booking flights. Before releasing the app to the public, they would conduct pilot tests by selecting a small group of users to test it in real-world scenarios\par
A pilot test is an initial test or a miniature version of a larger-scale study or project. \par
The term "pilot" means to test a plan, project, or other strategy before implementing it more fully across an organization.\par
A pilot test is generally conducted before beta testing in the case of a product or software release.\par
Pilot testing focuses on testing every single piece of your app, while user acceptance testing focuses on finding bugs and usability problems in the front end, or user side, of the app.\par
